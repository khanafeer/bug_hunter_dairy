# Yara Conditions

````bash
$txt_string or ($hex_string and $reg_ex) 
all of them // all strings in the rule
any of them // any string in the rule
all of ($a*) //all strings whose identifier starts by $a
any of ($a,$b,$c) // any of $a, $b or $c
1 of ($b*) // same that "any of them"
3 of them // matches any x of the strings


// Useful conditions to check if file is a PE
uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and // MZ signature at offset 0 and 
uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 // PE signature at offset stored in MZ header at 0x3C!

include "./includes/other.yar"! // include other rule files
